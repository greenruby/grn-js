Should I focus more? It would be annoying as I like eclecticism, in a certain range. Anyways, I'm happy to announce we almost have 500 subscribers by now, and more and more traffic on the website. You may laugh, but as I don't like google and their analytics/tracking, I use the good old webalizer for the Greenruby site stats. So vintage! Maybe one day I will setup a piwik though. "

        "edito": "Hmm I really don't like my icons. I added categories from time to time and got some random icon to match them. Now I look at the result and I don't like it. Maybe someone can suggest a collection that could match the Green Ruby categories collection? For example the ops and tool categories are too identical. and I need a generic engineering category too. It would be so lovely to have a uniform look for our icons. Maybe some monochrome Heroku style kind of 16 pixel icons. So, if you feel you can help, contact me at mose@greenruby.org. "
